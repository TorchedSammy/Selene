# Selene
> â˜„ A Lua injector and theming tool for Discord.

Have you ever wanted to make a custom theme for Discord? Maybe you have a lot
of color schemes and themes you'd like to switch between.

Selene is a CSS injector for Discord desktop, except you write the CSS with
Lua.

This is work in progress. More info soon!  
This requires [Hilbish](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish).

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Selene --recursive
cd Selene
hilbish selene.lua
npm i
mv node_modules fengari css.lua ~/.config/selene
```

# License
MIT

This would (probably) not exist without [discocss](https://github.com/mlvzk/discocss),
which Selene is based on, so credit to them.
